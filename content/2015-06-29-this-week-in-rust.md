# Other Changes

* [std: Add support for Windows XP](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/26601).
* [Reset signal behavior before starting children with std::process](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/25784). Resets Rust's SIGPIPE handler, as well as any signal mask that may have been set, before spawning a child.
* [MSVC: Implement runtime support for unwinding](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/26569). A key aspect is missing, however, which is that unwinding is still turned off by default for MSVC.
* [Suggest missing trait bounds when a method exists but the bounds aren't satisfied](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/26435).
